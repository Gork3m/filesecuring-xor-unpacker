# filesecuring-xor-unpacker
A static unpacker / deobfuscator for that Lua obfuscator called "filesecuring" / "xor".
This obfuscator was mainly used in FiveM communities, due to the way it detects load=print, it was pretty difficult to dump it by hooking lua functions.
They recently discontinued and opensourced their obfuscator, so I can publicly release my deobfuscator for it.
